# ibm-react-project
My very first react project while learning Fullstack Software Development by IBM on Coursera

cloned the project: git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/content_rating.git to my local computer, which came with the directory "content_rating". 
I then navigated to the directory, opened it and initiated VSC using code .

On the terminal, I typed the following commands:

npm install
npm run dev

The last command provided the URL: http://localhost:5173/ enabling me view my application.

In an uncloned project, I have to write 'npm create vite@latest' to install vite

Created this git repository "ibm-react-project" to host my codes and share with my networks.
